<h1>CPAN once-a-[% period %]</h1>
<p>
Release something to CPAN each [% period %]. How many [% period %]s can
you keep that up? Timings are in 'PAUSE time', which is GMT. The time
for your upload is the timestamp that PAUSE puts on your upload when it
goes into CPAN (which you can see on BackPAN). This is very close to the
'Request completed' timestamp, in the first email you get from PAUSE
when you upload something.

[% SWITCH period -%]
[% CASE 'month' -%]
In the monthly contest, months start on 00:00:00 UTC the first day of
the month, and end at midnight UTC on the last day of the month.
[% CASE 'week' -%]
In the weekly contest, weeks are counted from Sunday 00:00:00 UTC
until the next Saturday at midnight UTC. In the context of the contest,
the first week of the yearly contest is the first <b>full</b> week
of the year. For example, the first week of the 2014 contest started
on Sunday, January 5, 2014. In <code>strftime(2)</code> terms, this is
week 1 according to <code>%U</code>, with week 0 being part of the previous
year.
[% CASE 'day' -%]
In the daily contest, days start on 00:00:00 UTC and end at midnight UTC.
[% END -%]
