<h1>CPAN once-a-[% period %]</h1>
<p>
Release something to CPAN each [% period %]. How many [% period %]s can
you keep that up? Timings are in 'PAUSE time', which is GMT. The time
for your upload is the timestamp that PAUSE puts on your upload when it
goes into CPAN (which you can see on BackPAN). This is very close to the
'Request completed' timestamp, in the first email you get from PAUSE
when you upload something.

The tables below list the top [% limit %] participants.
