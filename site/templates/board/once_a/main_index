<h1>CPAN regular releasers boards</h1>

<p>On December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2011, <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/MARKF" class="cpanAuthor">MARKF</a> decided, in his new year's
resolution for 2012, to release a Perl distribution to the CPAN
<a href="http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2011/12/31/once-a-week-every-week/">once a week, every week</a>.</p>

<p>This immediately sparkled some interest, and although Mark failed to
keep his own resolution at some point in March 2012, the game was on.
At around the same time, <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/CJM" class="cpanAuthor">CJM</a> wrote <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTimeX::Seinfeld" class="module">DateTimeX::Seinfeld</a> and set up
a board following Mark's rules on <a href="http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/">http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/</a>.</p>

<p>In February 2014, <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/NEILB" class="cpanAuthor">NEILB</a> extended the game to include leaderboards
for monthly and daily release schedules.
Titled the <a href="http://neilb.org/cpan-regulars/">CPAN Regulars Releasers</a>,
his version of the game has stricter rules, using the timestamp as
recorded by PAUSE.</p>

<p>CPAN.io uses the same rules as <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/NEILB" class="cpanAuthor">NEILB</a>.</p>
