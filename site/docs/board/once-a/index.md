# CPAN regular releasers boards

On December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2011, A<MARKF> decided, in his new year's
resolution for 2012, to release a Perl distribution to the CPAN
[once a week, every week](http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2011/12/31/once-a-week-every-week/).

This immediately sparkled some interest, and although Mark failed to
keep his own resolution at some point in March 2012, the game was on.
At around the same time, A<CJM> wrote M<DateTimeX::Seinfeld> and set up
a board following Mark's rules on <http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net/>.

In February 2014, A<NEILB> extended the game to include leaderboards
for monthly and daily release schedules.
Titled the [CPAN Regulars Releasers](http://neilb.org/cpan-regulars/),
his version of the game has stricter rules, using the timestamp as
recorded by PAUSE.

CPAN.io uses the same rules as A<NEILB>.

- [once a month](month/)
- [once a week](week/)
- [once a day](day/)
