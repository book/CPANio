# CPAN.io game boards

For now, we only offer very few games to play:

- [once-a](once-a/) games,  
  where one tries to keep doing something every "period", for as long as possible:
    - [week](once-a/week/)
        - [releases](once-a/week/releases/)
        - [distributions](once-a/week/distributions/)
        - [new-distributions](once-a/week/new-distributions/)
    - [month](once-a/month/)
        - [releases](once-a/month/releases/)
        - [distributions](once-a/month/distributions/)
        - [new-distributions](once-a/month/new-distributions/)
    - [day](once-a/day/)
        - [releases](once-a/day/releases/)
