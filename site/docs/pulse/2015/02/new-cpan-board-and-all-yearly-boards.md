# All yearly boards at a glance

## New boards: top releases per period

It's already a month and a half since the new year started, and a new
contest sparked a burst of CPAN activity: the
[CPAN Pull Request Challenge](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/12/take-the-2015-cpan-pull-request-challenge.html),
instigated by our very own A<NEILB>.

To offer a better insight into the CPAN releases activity, we are now
publishing boards listing the top periods for each type of release.
These statistics about CPAN uploads are available for various periods:

- per [month](/board/top/month/)
    - [releases](/board/top/month/releases/)
    - [distributions](/board/top/month/distributions/)
    - [new-distributions](/board/top/month/new-distributions/)
- per [week](/board/top/week/)
    - [releases](/board/top/week/releases/)
    - [distributions](/board/top/week/distributions/)
    - [new-distributions](/board/top/week/new-distributions/)
- per [day](/board/top/day/)
    - [releases](/board/top/day/releases/)
    - [distributions](/board/top/day/distributions/)
    - [new-distributions](/board/top/day/new-distributions/)

## Yearly boards

Last August, we introduced the [yearly boards](/pulse/2014/08/yearly-boards.html),
for all the [regulars boards](/board/once-a/).

This enabled us to compute the yearly boards for past games, ever since
CPAN started, before people came up with silly competitions about releases.

Two days ago, we published pages showing the leaderboards for all those yearly
games, since 1995:

- [weekly releases](/board/once-a/week/releases/years.html)
- [weekly distributions](/board/once-a/week/distributions/years.html)
- [weekly new-distributions](/board/once-a/week/new-distributions/years.html)
- [monthly releases](/board/once-a/month/releases/years.html)
- [monthly distributions](/board/once-a/month/distributions/years.html)
- [monthly new-distributions](/board/once-a/month/new-distributions/years.html)
- [daily releases](/board/once-a/day/releases/years.html)

Similar indexes are also available for the top CPAN periods boards:

- [top weeks of releases](/board/top/week/releases/years.html)
- [top weeks of distributions](/board/top/week/distributions/years.html)
- [top weeks of new-distributions](/board/top/week/new-distributions/years.html)
- [top months of releases](/board/top/month/releases/years.html)
- [top months of distributions](/board/top/month/distributions/years.html)
- [top months of new-distributions](/board/top/month/new-distributions/years.html)
- [top days of releases](/board/top/day/releases/years.html)
- [top days of distributions](/board/top/day/distributions/years.html)
- [top days of new-distributions](/board/top/day/new-distributions/years.html)
