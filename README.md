# CPAN.io

This repository contains everything needed to build the
[CPAN.io](http://cpan.io/) web site.

The database is created with:

    $ bin/create-database

It is then populated with:

    $ bin/update-boards

While developing, it's possible to test the website with a browser by
running `plackup`:

    $ plackup bin/cpanio.cgi

And the static website is itself built with:

    $ bin/build-site

The live site on <http://cpan.io/> is generated hourly by running the
`bin/update-boards` and `bin/build-site` commands in a cron job.

All the assets are committed in the `site/static` directory.
They are generated by the `bin/build-assets` script, which only needs
to be run if modified.
